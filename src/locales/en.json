    "faq_a1": "LiveTL is, at its core, just a $bold$chat filter for YouTube streams. $red$LiveTL does not automatically translate streams$/bold$$/red$ – instead, it picks up translations found in the chat. This helps foreign viewers better catch translations that other viewers are providing in the YouTube Live Chat.",
    "faq_q2": "I opened my stream with LiveTL but it isn’t loading?",
    "faq_a2": "The chat may be temporarily unavailable. LiveTL will only load if the stream has a valid Live Chat or Chat Replay.",
    "faq_q3": "I don’t see any translations in the translations panel?",
    "faq_a3": "If there are no translators in chat, LiveTL is unable to display translations. Any messages properly tagged with a language code (ex. $code$[en] <translation>$/code$, $code$ESP: <translation>$/code$, etc.) will appear when they appear in chat.",
    "faq_q4": "A translator is using their own style of language tags, how do I make them show?",
